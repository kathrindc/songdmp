# ðŸŽ¶ songdmp 

Songdmp is a utility that can be used to dump information about currently playing songs into a file.
This allows you to easily display information on the music you play in a live-stream.
The application grabs the information via MRPIS, meaning it is player agnostic.
Any and all testing so far has been done with spotify, though it should work with other common players such as VLC without any issues.
